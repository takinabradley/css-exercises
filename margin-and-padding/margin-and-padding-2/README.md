# Margin and Padding #2

This one is a little nicer looking, and a little closer to something you might 
see in the real world. You'll need to change a little more than just margin and 
padding to make it look exactly right.

- There is 8px between the edge of the card and it's content (the blue sections)
  I made it 10px
  
- There is an 8px gap between each of the blue sections inside the card.
  I made it 10px
  
- Title of the card uses a 16px font.
  yes
  
- There are 8px between the title text and the edge of the title section.
  I made the padding 10px
  
- The content section has 16px space on the top and bottom, and 8px on either side.
  Oops, the padding looked like it had equal spacing to me. I also like it that 
  way to I'm keeping it.
- Everything inside the `.button` section is centered, and there is 8px padding.
  yes, and again 10px padding.
  
- the Big Button is centered on it's own line.
  The big button is centerd on it's own line as a block, using margin-left. I'm
  not sure why margin: 0 auto; works in the solution. 
  Edit: I figured it out.
  
- the Big Button has 24px space on the sides, and 8px on top and bottom.
  I did 20px on the sides, and 5px top and bottom.
