# A common 'modal' style

### A hint
Depending on how you approach this one, you might need to revisit the `flex-shrink` property to keep a flex item from getting smashed. In addition, pay attention to the structure of the html, specifically look into adding an additional container surrounding the header, button, main text, cancel, and continue divs; and look into moving the header div to encompass the button as well.
