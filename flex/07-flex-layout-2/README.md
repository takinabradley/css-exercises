# The Holy Grail of Layout

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this last flexbox exercise you're going to recreate an incredibly common 
website layout. It is so common that it is often called the 
[holy-grail](

and with flexbox it is actually pretty easy to pull off.

your screen, so don't stress about getting _exactly_ a 3x3 grid.
